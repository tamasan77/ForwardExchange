# Forward Exchange
A platform to create customizable decentralized forward contracts, with some properties of futures contracts.

Unlike traditional forward contracts ,this platform minimizes risks by
requiring the long and short parties to commit a collateral.
Additionally, similarly to futures contracts the two account are marked to market periodically.

For the forward contract users can select any underlying asset by agreeing on an API to use, margin requirements, what collateral token to use and the expiration date of the forward contract.
